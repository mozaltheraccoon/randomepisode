		This file randomly redirects a user to one of the URLs in a list. It is built

		For example, create three Google Docs forms (or equivalent) and add their URLs
		to the list below. That's it!
		The user is then automatically and randomly assigned to one of the URLs when
		the user visits this file. If the user decides to close and reopen the browser,
		the user is still redirected to the same URL since a cookie is saved in the
		user's browser.
